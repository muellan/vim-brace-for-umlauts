# vim-brace-for-umlauts

This is a very simple VIM plugin to improve the coding experience on German QUERTZ keyboards. It defines the following mappings:

 - normal, visual & select mode
    - ``` ü -> [ ```
    - ``` ä -> ] ```
    - ``` Ü -> { ```
    - ``` Ä -> } ```
    - ``` ö -> : ```

 - insert and command mode
    - ``` ü -> [ ```
    - ``` ä -> ] ```
    - ``` Ü -> { ```
    - ``` Ä -> } ```
    - ``` ö -> : ```
    - ``` Ö -> \ ```

You can use the commands **Umlauts**, **NoUmlauts** and **UmlautsToggle** to activate or deactivate the *insert & command mode* mappings in case you need to write German prose or search for text containing umlauts.

All mappings are activated on VIM startup.
